I made some changes in sectrans helm.
Because previously the repo name to rsync had been hardcoded in the docker file. 
I changed it to helm values, so for each stage, we can now give it in value.YAML file.

And one more thing, 
To do the group business contract testing again shall I ping Franz or do we need to arrange a meeting as we did before?  
when we are going to do this?

Hi Franz 

I am from Lukas's team, You helped us to test the group business contract service last Friday. 
We have fixed the issue. could you please help us to test one more time?

If you upload a test file and I will run it then you can check if its working or not.
