I made some changes in sectrans helm.
Because previously the repo name to rsync had been hardcoded in the docker file. 
I changed it to helm values, so for each stage, we can now give it in value.YAML file.

And one more thing, 
To do the group business contract testing again shall I ping Franz or do we need to arrange a meeting as we did before?  
when we are going to do this?

I deployed the asif nrs service in the ACM cloud and tested with a dummy test file. NRS  fetched and processed it. sectran can also sync the file to sftp server.

I checked with Bhusan for TEST and QA, He told me we can ignore the test stage and make the QA ready.
In QA starting next week Development for R23B will start.

And I thought of asking Franz to do a test on ASIF NRS with some real data. Like we did before on group business.


exclude it mnt and prod

Hi Lukas,

I checked with Franz, He had tested and said "looks good i think".

In the last test error response was not uploaded to the result folder, this time it uploaded correctly.

if ( !(a).startsWith('releases/R23') ) {
  println("$a")
