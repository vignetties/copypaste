I made some changes in sectrans helm.
Because previously the repo name to rsync had been hardcoded in the docker file. 
I changed it to helm values, so for each stage, we can now give it in value.YAML file.

And one more thing, 
To do the group business contract testing again shall I ping Franz or do we need to arrange a meeting as we did before?  
when we are going to do this?
